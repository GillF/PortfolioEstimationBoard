Why would you use this App?

This app provides a fast way to create and populate a multilevel Portfolio Item Hierarchy. If you want a way to start with a large project and see what it looks like broken into smaller pieces this is the App for you.

This app is used to estimate and Rank Portfolio Items using a CardBoard view. A parent Portfolio Item can be selected to filter the current view. If the view is currently filtered then all newly created Portfolio Items will be added as children to the currently selected parent as children.

If you want to grab the App and try it you can find it [here] (https://github.com/RallyCommunity/PortfolioEstimationBoard/blob/master/deploy/App.html).
