This app is used to estimate and Rank Portfolio Items using a CardBoard view. A parent Portfolio Item can be selected to filter the current view. If the view is currently filtered then you all newly created Portfolio Items will be added as children to the currently selected parent as children.

If you want to grab the App and try it you can find it [here] (https://github.com/RallyCommunity/PortfolioEstimationBoard/blob/master/deploy/App.html).
